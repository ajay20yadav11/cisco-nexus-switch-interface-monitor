Need of this code-

Parameters: CRF, INTPUT ERROR, OUTPUT ERROR, GIANTS, COLLISION, etc.

About all the monitoring tools available in the market, this code serves as a time bound monitoring for the interfaceâ€™s parameters for its errors.
When it comes to monitor the basic Level 1 Physical layer, we need to proactively monitor the parameters of physical interface. 

About How to Use the Code in Nexus Switches-

1. First we need to upload the file monitor-interface.py into the flash file.
2. We could execute this script within the privilege mode.
	nexus#python monitor-interface.py  
			OR
	nexus#python3 monitor-interface.py  
3. By executing this script, we will get the email alerts if the code has detected any change in the interface parameter value.
